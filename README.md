# Apollo Links

Just an example of React application with GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions (websockets are awesome).

## How to start
Install dependencies
``` bash
yarn install
```
OR
``` bash
npm install
```
Start React application at localhost:3005 in parallel with GraphQL server and playground at localhost:4000
``` bash
yarn start
```
OR
``` bash
npm start
```

The server based on [Prisma](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma) was downloaded [here](https://codeload.github.com/howtographql/react-apollo/tar.gz/starter).
