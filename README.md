# Apollo Links

Just an example of React application with GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions (websockets are awesome).

## How to start
``` bash
# Install dependencies with
yarn install
# OR with
npm install

# Start React application at localhost:3005
# and GraphQL server and playground at localhost:4000
npm start
```
The server based on [Prisma](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma) was downloaded [here](https://codeload.github.com/howtographql/react-apollo/tar.gz/starter).
